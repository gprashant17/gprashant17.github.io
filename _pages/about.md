Hello and ‡Æµ‡Æ£‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç! I am a fourth-year Computer Engineering PhD candidate at [Mila-Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/) and [Polytechnique Montr√©al](https://polymtl.ca/) (engineering school of [Ud√©M](https://www.umontreal.ca/)), working under [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/). I am keenly interested in reinforcement learning and large language models for scientific discovery and beyond. In collaboration with [Intel](https://www.intel.la/content/www/xl/es/research/overview.html), I developed offline and online reinforcement learning methods for crystalline material design using first-principles. I also worked with [Ansys](https://www.ansys.com/) on LLMs for automating Computer-Aided Design (CAD). My research is supported by the [PBEEE](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/frqnt-merit-scholarship-program-for-foreign-students-pbeee-2024-2025/) scholarship for international students.

I was previously a dual degree student at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/), where I worked under [Balaraman Ravindran](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~ravi/) and [Karthik Raman](https://home.iitm.ac.in/kraman/lab/karthik/) on target-specific drug design. Besides academics, I like playing traveling, frisbee, and cooking. Lately, I‚Äôve been learning to snowboard and play the flute. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about research or anything beyond üòÅ! I‚Äôm always eager to learn more about crystallography, DFT, and solid-state physics, and would love to exchange ideas, especially on the RL aspects of my work!

<span style="font-family: 'Inter', 'Roboto', 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; font-style: italic; font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; font-size: 1.1em;">I am actively seeking research internships in the areas of LLMs, reinforcement learning, and AI for Science.</span>

# Projects

## Fine-tuning LLMs for automating Computer-aided Designing
With Ansys, we developed CADmium, a new open-source dataset consisting of natural language descriptions for 170k+ 3D CAD objects. We propose a novel LLM fine-tuning workflow with code LLMs, and augment existing evaluation schemes with new metrics.
